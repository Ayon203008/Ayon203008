<h1>My projects</h1> 
<h3>Project name - SoulMate</h3>
<p> 

I developed a full-featured matrimony platform designed to help individuals find their life partners. The website provides a secure and user-friendly environment for creating profiles, connecting with potential matches, and building meaningful relationships. This project showcases my ability to build a complete, scalable, and secure full-stack application from the ground up.

I utilized React.js for the frontend, incorporating Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for a modern, responsive design. The backend was built with Express.js, while MongoDB was used as the database. For secure user authentication, I implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
